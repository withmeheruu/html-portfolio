<h1>The Best Movie According to Heru</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Inception (2010)</h3>
<p>This film has an incredibly complex storyline, revolving around the concept of dreams within dreams. I love how director Christopher Nolan blends elements of science fiction, psychology, and puzzles, making the audience think deeply about reality and consciousness. The visuals and effects are also stunning.</p>
<h3>The Shawshank Redemption (1994)</h3>
<p>This movie is filled with themes of hope, friendship, and freedom. The strong narrative and the main character, Andy Dufresne, who demonstrates resilience in the face of injustice, make this film incredibly inspiring. I also appreciate how it showcases the power of the human spirit to endure tough situations.</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight (2008)</h3>
<p>This is one of the best superhero films, in my opinion. Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker is iconic and deeply layered. The film isn't just about action but also explores themes of morality, sacrifice, and the dilemmas a hero faces in protecting the city from very real threats.</p>
